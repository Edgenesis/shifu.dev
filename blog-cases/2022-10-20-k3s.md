# How to deploy Shifu on K3s to complete the cloud-edge-device cycle

## Background
[K3s](https://k3s.io/) is the open source, lightweight version of Kubernetes developed by SUSE. It can run on the edge where computing power is constrained, which makes it ideal for scenarios with IoT devices.

As a Kubernetes native open-source IoT development framework, ***Shifu*** abstracts each IoT device into K8s pods, and expose their capabilities to applications as APIs.

| worker node | amd64/arm/arm64 | at least 1 | at least 2GB | 16GB | networkable, with access to master node |

### Steps

1. Deploy the wireguard server on the server side

    a. Install
      
      https://github.com/angristan/wireguard-install
    
    b. Run the following command:
     ```   
     curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angristan/wireguard-install/master/wireguard-install.sh
     chmod +x wireguard-install.sh
     . /wireguard-install.sh
     ```
     c. Enter the public IP of the server and add users on demand. The following is the actual output, please make alterations on demand.
      ```
      root@localhost:~# . /wireguard-install.sh 
      Welcome to the WireGuard installer!
      The git repository is available at: https://github.com/angristan/wireguard-install
       
      I need to ask you a few questions before starting the setup.
      You can leave the default options and just press enter if you are ok with them.
       
      IPv4 or IPv6 public address: 192.168.0.1 # Change this to your public IP, you can get it by "curl ip.sb"
      Public interface: ens5
      WireGuard interface name: wg0
      Server's WireGuard IPv4: 10.66.66.1 # IPv4 address of wireguard server interface, use the default value if there is no special requirement
      Server's WireGuard IPv6: fd42:42:42::1 # IPv6 address of the wireguard server interface, use the default value if there is no special requirement
      Server's WireGuard port [1-65535]: 64191 # Change this to your port, you need to allow UDP in the host's firewall after opening the port
      First DNS resolver to use for the clients: 114.114.114.114
      Second DNS resolver to use for the clients (optional): 119.29.29.29
       
      Okay, that was all I needed. we are ready to setup your WireGuard server now.
      .................................
      The output here is omitted
      .................................
      Tell me a name for the client.
      The name must consist of alphanumeric character. It may also include an underscore or a dash and can't exceed 15 chars.
      Client name: client1 # After installation prompt for a username, customize it
      Client's WireGuard IPv4: 10.66.66.2 # IPv4 address of the wireguard client interface, use the default value if there is no special requirement
      Client's WireGuard IPv6: fd42:42:42::2 # The IPv6 address of the wireguard client interface, use the default value if there is no special requirement
      .................................
      The output here is omitted
      .................................
      It is also available in /home/ubuntu/wg0-client-client1.conf # Generate a configuration file for the worker node
      ```
     d. Please save the configuration file `/home/ubuntu/wg0-client-client1.conf` generated by the script, it will be putted on the worker node.
     e. After you run the script and has successfully added the interface, you can check the status by running `wg show all`.
   ```
   root@localhost:~# wg show all
   interface: wg0
     public key: adsdadhkaskdhadkjhs12312kl3j1l2o
     private key: (hidden)
     listening port: 64191
    
   peer: adsdadhkaskdhadkjhs12312kl3j1l2odsada2
     preshared key: (hidden)
     allowed ips: 10.66.66.2/32, fd42:42:42::2/128
    ```
     f. At this point, the server-side configuration is complete, if you need more clients just execute `. /wireguard-install.sh`

2. Deploy K3s server on the server side
  
   a. When you are done with step 1, you can deploy K3s on the server side through the wireguard interface, the command is as follows:
    ```
    curl -sfL https://rancher-mirror.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/k3s/k3s-install.sh | INSTALL_K3S_MIRROR=cn K3S_TOKEN=token INSTALL_K3S_EXEC = "--advertise-address=10.66.66.1 --flannel-iface=wg0" sh -
    ```  

   b. Configuration items

    - `K3S_TOKEN=token`, where `token` is changed on demand, but worker nodes should be consistent when joining

    - `INSTALL_K3S_EXEC="--advertise-address=10.66.66.1 ---flannel-iface=wg0"`, here we have configured two items
      - `--advertise-address=10.66.66.1 `, using the wireguard interface as the IP for connection, instead of the server IP
      - `--flannel-iface=wg0`, inform the flannel component of K3s to use wg0 interface

 c. The output should be as follows:
 ```

 root@localhost:~#
 ```
   d. Run `kubectl get pods -A ` to ensure all pods are running:
   
   ```
   ~# kubectl get pods -A
   NAMESPACE NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
   kube-system coredns-b96499967-hs6bn 1/1 Running 0 4m14s
   kube-system local-path-provisioner-7b7dc8d6f5-8szzd 1/1 Running 0 4m14s

   kube-system traefik-7cd4fcff68-b6cjj 1/1 Running 0 3m49s
   ```
  
   e. Check master node status by running `kubectl get nodes`:
   ```
   #kubectl get nodes
   NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION
   ip-172-31-37-138 Ready control-plane,master 8m35s v1.24.4+k3s1
   ```
   f. At this point, K3s should be successfully deployed on the server-side
3. configure wireguard on worker node

:::tip
This tutorial uses an `Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS` server running on ARM64 for demonstration purposes
:::

   a. Update the software list and install `resolvconf` and `wireguard`:

   ```
   apt-get update && apt-get install resolvconf wireguard -y
   ```
   b. Fill the following configuration in `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`:

:::note
The last line in the configuration file `AllowedIPs` is ` 0.0.0.0/0,::/0` by default, you need to change it to the wireguard IP address `10.66.66.0/24`
:::
   
   ```
   [Interface]
   PrivateKey = casasdlaijo()(hjdsasdasdihasddad
   Address = 10.66.66.2/32,fd42:42:42::2/128
   DNS = 114.114.114.114,119.29.29.29
    
   [Peer]
   PublicKey = asdasd21edawd3resaedserw3rawd
   PresharedKey = dasda23e134e3edwadw3reqwda
   Endpoint = 192.168.0.1:64191 # This should be the public IP of the server and the open UDP port
   AllowedIPs = 10.66.66.0/24 # Note that the default here is 0.0.0.0/0 and needs to be changed
   ```
  c. Run the following command to bring up the wg0 interface:
      ```
      wg-quick up /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf 
      ```
  d. Test the interface by `ping 10.66.66.1`, if the ping is successfull, then it is in effect.
   ```
   root@k3s:~# ping 10.66.66.1
   PING 10.66.66.1 (10.66.66.1) 56(84) bytes of data.

   rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 7.659/12.345/18.863/3.729 ms
   ```

4. Configure K3s agent on worker nodes
   
   a. Install K3s and join the cluster:
   ```
   curl -sfL https://rancher-mirror.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/k3s/k3s-install.sh | INSTALL_K3S_MIRROR=cn K3S_TOKEN=token K3S_URL https:// 10.66.66.1:6443 INSTALL_K3S_EXEC="--node-ip=10.66.66.3 --flannel-iface=wg0" sh -
   ```
   b. Configuration items:
      
    - `K3S_TOKEN=token`, where `token` needs to be changed to the token filled in when the server was created
    
    - `INSTALL_K3S_EXEC="--advertise-address=10.66.66.3 --flannel-iface=wg0"`, where we have configured three items.

      - `-K3S_URL=https://10.66.66.1:6443`, the IP of the master node, here it is 10.66.66.1

      - `--advertise-address=10.66.66.3`, the interface of the wireguard is used as the IP for connection, instead of the worker IP
      - `--flannel-iface=wg0`, inform the flannel component of K3s to use wg0 interface
c. The output should be as follows:
   ```
   [INFO] Finding a stable channel version
   [INFO] Use v1.24.4+k3s1 as release version.
   [INFO] Download hash rancher-mirror.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/k3s/v1.24.4-k3s1/sha256sum-arm64.txt

   [INFO] systemd. start k3s-agent
   root@k3s:~# 
   ```
  d. On the server side, you can check whether the node has been added by `kubectl get nodes`:
   ```
   #kubectl get nodes
   Name Status Role Age Version
   ip-172-31-37-138 Ready control-plane,master 24m v1.24.4+k3s1
   k3s Ready <none> 2m52s v1.24.4+k3s1
   ````



5. Deploy ***Shifu*** by cloud collaboration
  
   a. Clone ***Shifu***:
   ```
   git clone https://gitee.com/edgenesis/shifu.git
   ```
   Modify the image inside the controller (may not be pulled down in China):
    
    ``vim shifu/pkg/k8s/crd/install/shifu_install.yml``
    
    Replace line 428 with
    
    `image: bitnami/kube-rbac-proxy:latest`
   
   b. Install ***Shifu***:

   ` kubectl apply -f shifu/pkg/k8s/crd/install/shifu_install.yml `
   
   c. Lable the worker node of K3s:
  
     `kubectl label nodes k3s type=worker`

     d. Try to run the Pod on the specified node, e.g. an `nginx` Pod:

   ```
   kubectl run nginx --image=nginx -n deviceshifu --overrides='{"spec": { "nodeSelector": { "type": "worker"}}}'
   ```
     e. Run `kubectl get pods -n deviceshifu -owide`, we can see that we have successfully run the pod on the edge node `k3s`
   ```
   #kubectl get pods -n deviceshifu -owide
   NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE IP NODE NOMINATED NODE
   nginx 1/1 Running 0 42s 10.42.1.3 k3s
   ````


6. deploy a digital twin of the Hikvision camera
  
   a. Login to [***shifu.cloud***](https://shifu.cloud)

   ***Shifu Cloud*** is a PaaS based on the open source IoT development framework ***Shifu*** developed by Edgenesis, which provides convenient tools for developers to integrate IoT devices by simply filling in basic information. Without ***Shifu Cloud***, developers need to manually fill in the YAML configuration files and then deploy the virtual devices.

   <img src="/blog-221020/登入cloud.png" width="70%" />
   
   b. Add device

   <img src="/blog-221020/添加设备.png" width="70%" />

   c. Select Private Protocol --> Select Hikvision in the drop-down menu, then click Next

   <img src="/blog-221020/选择协议.png" width="70%" />

     
   d. Add basic information about the device, such as device name, manufacturer and model:\

   <img src="/blog-221020/添加基本信息.png" width="70%" />
   
   e. Fill in the IP address, RTSP username and password

   <img src="/blog-221020/IP地址.png" width="60%" />
   
   f. Click Access and go to Add Interface

   <img src="/blog-221020/前往添加端口.png" width="60%" />
  
   
   g. Finally click Upload and ***Shifu Cloud*** will automatically generate the YAML file for ***deviceShifu*** (the digital twin)

   <img src="/blog-221020/自动生成Yaml文件.png" width="60%" />
   
   h. Copy the command and run it on the master node of K3s
   <img src="/blog-221020/复制命令.png" width="60%" />
   
   i. The output should be as follows:
      ```
      root@localhost:~# kubectl apply -f https://******.com/*****/******.yaml
      configmap/deviceshifu-devicehikvision-configmap created
      service/deviceshifu-devicehikvision-service created
      deployment.apps/deviceshifu-devicehikvision-deployment created
      edgedevice.shifu.edgenesis.io/edgedevice-devicehikvision created
      root@localhost:~# 
      ```

      - What happens behind the scenes
      ***Shifu Cloud*** automatically generates the digital twin's YAML files (Edge Device, ConfigMap, Deployment and Service) with some basic information filled in by the user, if you want to go deeper, go to [github](https://github.com/Edgenesis/shifu/tree/main/examples/rtspDeviceShifu) to see the deployment specific files
      
   j. ***Shifu Cloud*** does not support adding nodeSelector for now (stay tuned), the device twin will be deployed on the master node by default, we need to update the `spec` in the deployment file to deploy the Pod in the worker node:

    - We get the name of the current deployment file with the command
         ```
         root@localhost:~# kubectl get deployment -n deviceshifu
         NAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE
         deviceshifu-devicehikvision-deployment 0/1 1 0 16m
         ```
      
    - Then edit the deployment with the ``kubectl edit deployment -n deviceshifu deviceshifu-devicehikvision-deployment`` command, add the following two lines and save it:
      ```
         ......
               nodeSelector:                                                                                                                            
                 type: worker
         ......
      ```
   <img src="/blog-221020/添加命令.png" width="70%" />
   
   k. At this point we look again and see that the digital twin has been deployed to the edge node `k3s`:
   ```
   root@localhost:~# kubectl get pods -n deviceshifu -owide
   NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE IP NODE NOMINATED NODE READINESS GATES
   nginx 1/1 Running 0 165m 10.42.1.4 k3s <none> <none>
   deviceshifu-devicehikvision-deployment-5f56fb56d9-2ph5s 2/2 Running 0 21s 10.42.1.6 k3s <none> <none>
   ```

### Outcome

  1. Now we can try to interact with the camera. Let's run an nginx container on the master node to simulate the interaction between the application and ***devicesShifu*** by running `kubectl run nginx-master -n deviceshifu --image=nginx` and we can see that ` nginx-master` is indeed running on the master node: 
      ```
      root@localhost:~# kubectl get po -n deviceshifu -owide
      NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE IP NODE NOMINATED NODE READINESS GATES
      nginx 1/1 Running 0 169m 10.42.1.4 k3s <none> <none>
      deviceshifu-devicehikvision-deployment-5f56fb56d9-2ph5s 2/2 Running 0 3m53s 10.42.1.6 k3s <none> <none>
      nginx-master 1/1 Running 0 32s 10.42.0.11 localhost <none> <none>
      ```
  2. We can use `kubectl exec -it -n deviceshifu nginx -- bash `to get to `nginx-master`, so that we can interact directly with the digital twin and obtain the meta information:
   ```
   root@localhost:~# kubectl exec -it -n deviceshifu nginx -- bash
   root@nginx:/# curl deviceshifu-devicehikvision-service/info
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"? >
   <DeviceInfo version="2.0" xmlns="http://www.hikvision.com/ver20/XMLSchema">

   <supportBeep>true</supportBeep
   <supportVideoLoss>false</supportVideoLoss
   <firmwareVersionInfo>B-R-E7-0</firmwareVersionInfo>
   </DeviceInfo>
   ```
The camera can be controlled directly by the following command:
   ```
   curl deviceshifu-devicehikvision-service/move/{up/down/left/right}
   ```
<video src="/blog-221020/2022-09-27_20-36-23.mp4" width="80%"></video>

  If we want to see what the camera is currently shooting and the current video stream, we need forward the local port to a pod by using `kubectl port-forward -n deviceshifu service/deviceshifu-devicehikvision-service 30080:80 -- address 0.0.0.0`
The image/video stream can be viewed directly by entering the server's IP and port number in the browser:
   ```
   <SERVER_IP>:30080/capture
   ```

   ```
   <SERVER_IP>:30080/stream
   ```

   <video src="/blog-221020/2022-09-27_21-05-31.mp4" width="80%"></video>


## Summary
In this article, we shared how to run ***Shifu*** in a K3s cluster, and achieve cloud-collaborative device control and data collection.

In the future, ***Shifu Cloud*** will continue to integrate with Kubernetes, add deployment control for edge nodes and automatically deploy device twins to the cluster without manual replication.

Thank you very much for reading, we look forward to your feedback, don't hesitate to leave comments if you like this article or have any suggestions.
