# Shifu with EMQX

> `EMQX` is a popular `MQTT Broker` in the world. It has a cloud-native architecture based on `Kubernetes`, making it extremely suitable for the increasingly complex IoT scenarios and making the transmission of device messages more efficient. ***Shifu***, as a `Kubernetes` native framework, can be perfectly combined with `EMQX` to provide `EMQX` with intelligent multi-protocol device linkage capabilities. 

## Introduction

This article will show you how to deploy `EMQX` and ***Shifu*** in a cluster, integrate a thermometer with `MQTT` as the communication method and a Hikvision camera with `RTSP` as the transmission protocol, and add an application to interact with ***Shifu*** so that every time the thermometer detects a body temperature above 37 degrees it will ask the camera to take a photo.

The simple architecture used in this article is as follows.

## Preparation

The following services and tools are used in this article.

1. `Kubernetes`: 1.20.10
    - `kubectl`
    - `kubeadm`
    - `kubelet`
1. `Golang`: 1.16.10
1. `Docker`: 19.03.9
1. `EMQX`: 4.1-rc1

## Step 1 Deploy Kubernetes

For this step, you can refer to the official `Kubernetes` tutorial for deployment: `Kubernetes`.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/

After the deployment is complete we should see the following message printed on the terminal.

## Step 2 Deploy Shifu

Clone the GitHub repository for ***Shifu*** locally to.

```
git clone https://github.com/Edgenesis/shifu.git
```

You can then deploy ***Shifu*** with the following command.

```
kubectl apply -f shifu/pkg/k8s/crd/install/shifu_install.yml
```

Once deployed we should see that the `CRD controller` for ***Shifu*** has been deployed.

## Step 3 Deploy EMQX

First you need to install `EMQX` `Operator Controller`.

```
$ curl -f -L "https://github.com/emqx/emqx-operator/releases/download/1.1.6/emqx-operator-controller.yaml" | kubectl apply -f -
```

Then we write the simplest `deployment.yaml`:

Then it's time to deploy an EMQX:

```
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

## Step 4 Integrate into the device

For the thermometer, we just need to adjust its `MQTT` settings so that it can post `MQTT` messages to `EMQX`.

(For thermometers outside the cluster, we can open up `External IP` for access via `Kubernetes Service`)

<img src="/blog-220610/5.png" width="100%" />

In terms of cameras, ***Shifu***'s repository already includes a [configuration file for Hikvision cameras using `RTSP`](https://github.com/Edgenesis/shifu/tree/main/examples/rtspDeviceShifu/) that we can simply change IP, username, password in the config file to integrate the camera into ***Shifu***.

At this point, our device is connected and we are ready to start linking below.

## Linking Applications

We can write a `Python` application to implement the following logic.

The app subscribes to `EMQX`  `temperature-shifu-mqtt` messages, each message includes only a number refering the current temperature; if the current temperature is higher than 37 degrees, the camera is asked take a picture and save it locally.

The application code is as follows.

Add a `capture function` to encapsulate all camera actions. Then we can deploy it to the cluster and start monitoring. 

```
python3 app.py 10.244.0.33
```

## Summary

This article shows how to get `EMQX` to empower ***Shifu*** with more efficient `MQTT Broker` capabilities, and make ***Shifu*** to work with `MQTT` to provide linkage capabilities to devices. In a real-world application scenario, we can use a cheap combination of IR thermometer and camera to replace thousands of dollars of unstable temperature cameras, saving huge costs in a large-scale deployment scenario.
