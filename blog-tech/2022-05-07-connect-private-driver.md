# Integrate a Private Driver

In this article, we will first write a `GPIO` driver to control `LED` using `Python`, and then connect it to ***Shifu*** for interaction and management.

## Create the driver

### Objective

- Complete simple LED circuit connection
- Basic Raspberry Pi/SSH configuration
- Basic Python syntax and knowledge of GPIO libraries

### Devices

- Raspberry Pi `Raspberry Pi 3B+` running 64-bit `Raspberry Pi OS`
- 1 breadboard
- 3 LED bulbs (red, yellow, green)
- 1 x 330 ohm resistor

### Basic knowledge

- Simple Python syntax
- Basic Linux command line operations (create files, install apps, SSH, run programs)

### Step 1 Circuit design

First let's design the circuit. We need to design a circuit that will allow the `GPIO` output of the Raspberry Pi to control the on/off of a single LED bulb. In this article, we have used the most straightforward approach, i.e., using `GPIO` directly to power the LED bulbs.

The circuit diagram is as follows.

<img src="/blog-220507/1.png" width="50%" />

The `GPIO` pins 22, 23, and 19 control the red, green, and yellow LEDs respectively. 330 ohms resistors are connected in series at the end to prevent the LEDs from burning out due to excessive current.

### Step 2 Circuit Implementation

According to the Pin Layout in the official `Raspberry Pi` documentation, we can see the exact location of the pins, here pins 15, 16, 35 and 39 are used.

<img src="/blog-220507/2.png" width="100%" />

Connect these four pins to the female port of the cable, and then connect the remaining circuits on the breadboard too.

<img src="/blog-220507/3.png" width="100%" />

The red, green, yellow, and gray cables in the diagram correspond to `GPIO22` `GPIO23` `GPIO19` and ground, respectively.

<img src="/blog-220507/4.png" width="50%" />

<img src="/blog-220507/5.png" width="50%" />

This concludes the circuit design and connectivity section.

### Step 3 Raspberry Pi Preparation

First install an operating system in the Raspberry Pi, the one used in this article is `Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)`. [download link](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/#raspberry-pi-os-64-bit)

Insert the SD card into the reader, connect it to the USB port of your computer, and then swipe the downloaded zip file into the SD card via `balenaEtcher`. [balenaEtcher link](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)

Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi, plug in the power and monitor cable, and we can start the configuration.

First, for development/debugging we need to enable SSH, open a terminal from the desktop and enter `sudo raspi-config` to access the configuration screen and select `Interface Options`.

<img src="/blog-220507/6.png" width="100%" />

Select `SSH`:

<img src="/blog-220507/7.png" width="100%" />

Press enter, then press left to select `Yes` to enable the SSH service: <img src="/blog-220507/7.png

<img src="/blog-220507/8.png" width="100%" />

After that, press right and select `Finish`, then enter to exit.

<img src="/blog-220507/9.png" width="100%" />

At this point, the SSH service is on, but we need to know the IP of the Raspberry Pi in order to SSH, so we can check it with the built-in `ip addr` command.

<img src="/blog-220507/10.png" width="100%" />

As you can see, the IP address is `192.168.15.122`.

Back in the computer, you can remotely access the Raspberry Pi from the command line via `ssh pi@192.168.15.122`

<img src="/blog-220507/11.png" width="100%" />

This concludes the preparation of the Raspberry Pi and the hardware.

:::note
Earlier versions of the Raspberry Pi OS may need to manually enable GPIO
:::

### Step 4 Write a Driver

Everything is in place, now let's write the first driver!

First make sure that `Python` is installed on your system, if not you can run the following command.

```
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt install python3 -y
```

After installation, you can check the status of the installation with `python -V`, if it shows the version, then the installation is successful:

```
$ python -V
Python 3.9.2
```

Next let's start with an LED bulb control, we want to control the red LED on/off using the following code.

<img src="/blog-220507/12.png" width="100%" />

The modules used in the driver are:

- `RPi.GPIO` to control the GPIO of the Raspberry Pi
- `argparse` is used to parse command line input

First set the GPIO mode to `GPIO.BCM` mode, in this mode the pin numbers are the GPIO numbers, not the pin order on the Raspberry Pi board.

`GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)`

Then turn the warning off, the Raspberry Pi will only be controlled only by this driver in this article.

`GPIO.setwarnings(False)`

Next process the program input, this driver will accept two inputs.

1. `-p`, `--port`, representing the GPIO pin that the program is manipulating
2. `-o`, `--operate`, represents the program's operation of the GPIO pin, `on` represents `1`, i.e. `3.3V` in the circuit, `off` represents `0`, i.e. `0V` in the circuit

The code is as follows

```py
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument("-p", "--pin", type=int, default=None, help="Specify the GPIO pin to operate, e.g.: '17'")
parser.add_argument("-o", "--operate", type=str, default=None, help="Specify the GPIO output, e.g.: 'on/off'")
args = parser.parse_args()
```

Next we need to handle errors, passing the arguments into the function `turnOnLed` to operate when the pin count and operation are not empty, otherwise printing a warning

```py
if args.pin and args.operate:
    turnOnLed(args.pin, args.operator)
else:
    print("need to specify both pin and operate arguments, type --help for more information")
```

The main part of the program ends, so let's look at the function `turnOnLed` that controls the LED bulb.

The first thing is to determine whether the `operate` variable is `on` or `off`, otherwise it returns. The output variable `gpio_out` is set to `GPIO.HIGH` when the variable is `on` and to `GPIO.LOW` when it is `off`.

These two values represent on or off.

```py
if operate == "on":
    gpio_out = GPIO.HIGH
elif operate == "off":
    gpio_out = GPIO.LOW
else:
    print("operate is neither on/off, quitting...")
    return
```

The last thing is to set the mode of the pin to output: `GPIO.setup(pin, GPIO.OUT)`

and switch the pin's output to on/off: `GPIO.output(pin, gpio_out)`

### Outcome

The program can be executed using `python led_driver.py -p {pin #} -o {operate}`

If we want to make the red bulb light up, we run `python led_driver.py -p 22 -o on`

<img src="/blog-220507/13.gif" width="100%" />

And that's it, a simple control LED bulb driver for Raspberry Pi!

:::note
This driver essentially manipulates Raspberry Pi GPIO pin, so we can also use this driver to manipulate any circuit that can be controlled by 3.3V, and the pins are not limited to 22, 23 and 19 in this article. You can use your imagination to create a variety of test circuits.
:::

## Integrate into Shifu

Next, we use the driver we wrote to access the ***Shifu*** framework for interaction and management.

The ***Shifu*** architecture in this article is as follows.

<img src="/blog-220507/connect-0.jpeg" width="100%" />

The northbound opens up the `HTTP` API interface via `deviceshifu-http-http` and the southbound interacts with the actual device via `rpio-gpio-driver`.

### Objectives

1. install k3s cluster on Raspberry Pi and install Shifu Framework
2. package the Raspberry Pi LED driver to a container image
3. deploy the digital twin of the Raspberry Pi LED in Shifu
4. Achieve remote automation control of Raspberry Pi LEDs

### Devices

- Raspberry Pi `Raspberry Pi 3B+` running 64-bit `Raspberry Pi OS`

### Basic knowledge

- basic operation of Docker/containerd
- basic operation of K8s/K3s

### Step 1 Install k3s

First we need to run a `Kubernetes cluster` in the Raspberry Pi. There is no restriction on the version users can use here, but to save resources we use `k3s` in this article. [Installation Tutorial](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/quick-start/)

After installation, run `kubectl version` to see the current `Kubernetes` version.

<img src="/blog-220507/connect-1.png" width="100%" />

Use `kubectl get nodes` to see the status of the current cluster, showing `Ready` means the cluster is available:

<img src="/blog-220507/connect-2.png" width="100%" />

At this point, the `k3s` installation is complete.

### Step 2 Install Shifu

First clone the ***Shifu*** project repository on your computer:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Edgenesis/shifu.git
```

You can deploy ***Shifu*** to the `k3s` cluster with one click by using `kubectl apply -f shifu/pkg/k8s/crd/install/shifu_install.yml`.

<img src="/blog-220507/connect-3.png" width="100%" />

Execute `kubectl get pods -A` again to see the `Shifu Framework` controller deployed to the cluster: <img src="/blog-220507/connect-3.png

<img src="/blog-220507/connect-4.png" width="100%" />

We can also manage device resources (currently there are no devices) via `edgedevices` the `CRD`: <img src="/blog-220507/connect-4.png

<img src="/blog-220507/connect-5.png" width="100%" />

At this point,  ***Shifu*** is successfully installed.

### Step 3 Package the driver

We need to use a small tool provided by ***Shifu*** to realize that we can manipulate the local driver remotely, for a detailed tutorial please see.

- New version: https://github.com/Edgenesis/shifu/tree/main/cmd/httpstub/sshstub
- Older version: https://github.com/Edgenesis/shifu/tree/c0cab1ce98870eb470ddc9e01e1d99c13b611411/driver_util

This tool helps to convert HTTP requests sent by the user/program to a local command line for execution.

A sample driver is provided inside the tutorial at https://github.com/Edgenesis/shifu/blob/main/examples/driver_utils/simple-alpine/Dockerfile.sample

The content is as follows.

<img src="/blog-220507/connect-6.png" width="100%" />

You can see that the `Dockerfile` has two parts, the first is to use the `golang` image to compile the `http_to_ssh_stub.go` provided by ***Shifu*** to convert HTTP command to SSH command. The next step is to use an empty `alpine` image to configure SSH for demonstration.

Next let's practice it.

Considering the limitations of Raspberry Pi, this compilation will be executed from the computer side, and the compiled image will be pushed to `Docker Hub` for remote invocation.

First, we create a new folder, here we use `dev`, and then save the created Raspberry Pi LED driver to this directory:.

```
dev/
└── led_driver.py
```

The driver content remains the same.

<img src="/blog-220507/connect-7.png" width="100%" />

Copy `Dockerfile.sample` from the `driver_util/examples/simple-alpine/` directory of the ***Shifu*** project to the `dev` directory.

```
dev/
├── Dockerfile.sample
└── led_driver.py
```

Change the following fields to change the second part of the image from `alpine` to `python:alpine`, install the `Python` library for `RPi.GPIO`

Finally, copy the `Python driver` into the run container, and the new `Dockerfile` will look like this, with the changes marked with comments.

```Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.17.1 as builder
 
WORKDIR /
 
ENV GOPROXY=https://goproxy.cn,direct
ENV GO111MODULE=on
ENV GOPRIVATE=github.com/Edgenesis

    && passwd -d root \
    && mkdir ~/.ssh \

    && cp /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub~/.ssh/authorized_keys
 
RUN apk add --no-cache -Uu --virtual .build-dependencies libffi-devopenssl-dev build-base musl \
    && pip3 install --no-cache --upgrade RPi.GPIO\
    && apk del --purge .build-dependencies \
    && apk add --no-cache --purge curlca-certificates musl \
    && rm -rf /var/cache/apk/* /tmp/*  # modified
 
WORKDIR /root/

COPY dev/led_driver.py led_driver.py  # modified
RUN chmod +x docker-entrypoint.sh
 
# Command to run the executable
ENTRYPOINT ["./docker-entrypoint.sh"]
```
Next we will package the Docker image, because the CPU of the Raspberry Pi is `ARM64` processor, the computer used for compiling in this article is `x86-64`, so we need to use the `buildx` function of `Docker` to build the image, the tutorial about buildx will not be described in this article, you can move to <https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/>.

Use `docker buildx build --platform=linux/arm64 -f dev/Dockerfile.sample . -t edgehub/rpi-gpio-driver:v0.0.1 --push` to build the image and push it to `Docker Hub`.

At this point, the image packaging part is complete.

### Step 4 Deploy device twin to Raspberry Pi

Once we have the image, we can deploy the digital twin to the cluster, so let's prepare the files we need for the deployment.

First is a `Kuberenetes Deployment YAML` file to run ***deviceShifu*** and the driver `Pod`.

<details>
  <summary> deviceshifu-rpi-gpio-deployment.yaml </summary> 

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: edgedevice-rpi-gpio-deployment
  name: edgedevice-rpi-gpio-deployment
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: edgedevice-rpi-gpio-deployment
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: edgedevice-rpi-gpio-deployment
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: edgehub/deviceshifu-http-http:v0.0.1
        name: deviceshifu-http
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        volumeMounts:
        - name: edgedevice-config
          mountPath: "/etc/edgedevice/config"
          readOnly: true
        env:
        - name: EDGEDEVICE_NAME
          value: "edgedevice-rpi-gpio"
        - name: EDGEDEVICE_NAMESPACE
          value: "devices"
      - image: edgehub/rpi-gpio-driver:v0.0.1
        name: driver
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /dev/gpiomem
          name: gpiomem
        securityContext:
          privileged: true
        ports:
        - containerPort: 11112
        env:
        - name: EDGEDEVICE_DRIVER_SSH_KEY_PATH
          value: "/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key"
        - name: EDGEDEVICE_DRIVER_HTTP_PORT
          value: "11112"
        - name: EDGEDEVICE_DRIVER_EXEC_TIMEOUT_SECOND
          value: "5"
        - name: EDGEDEVICE_DRIVER_SSH_USER
          value: "root"
      volumes:
      - name: edgedevice-config
        configMap:
          name: rpi-gpio-configmap-0.0.1
      - name: gpiomem
        hostPath:
          path: /dev/gpiomem
      serviceAccountName: edgedevice-sa
```
</details>

Please note that in the Deployment file we need to add `privileged: true` to the container's `securityContext`, so that we can use the Raspberry Pi's GPIO in the container, then mount the Raspberry Pi's `/dev/gpiomem` to the container as volume.

Write a `Kubernetes Service YAML` file to proxy requests from the ***deviceShifu*** to the real `Pod` from the domain.

<details>
  <summary> deviceshifu-rpi-gpio-service.yaml </summary> 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: edgedevice-rpi-gpio-deployment
  name: edgedevice-rpi-gpio
  namespace: default
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: edgedevice-rpi-gpio-deployment
  type: LoadBalancer
```
</details>

A `Kubernetes ConfigMap YAML` file to configure ***deviceShifu***.

<details>
  <summary> deviceshifu-rpi-gpio-configmap.yaml </summary> 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: rpi-gpio-configmap-0.0.1
  namespace: default
data:
  driverProperties: |
    driverSku: RaspberryPiB+
    driverImage: edgenesis/rpi-gpio-python:v0.0.1
    driverExecution: "python led_driver.py"
  instructions: |
    pin:
    operate:
    help:
# Telemetries are configurable health checks of the EdgeDevice
# Developer/user can configure certain instructions to be usedas health check # of the device.
# of the device. In this example, the device_health telemetry ismapped to
# "get_status" instruction, executed every 1000 ms
  telemetries: |
    device_health:
      properties:
        instruction: help
        initialDelayMs: 1000
        intervalMs: 1000
```
</details>

In `ConfigMap` we need to configure the execution path of the driver, because we put the Python file directly under the default path when generating the image, just fill in `python led_driver.py` here. If the driver is a binary file, you can directly fill in the binary directory here.

Write a `Shifu EdgeDevice YAML` file to generate the device twin.

<details>
  <summary> edgedevice-rpi-gpio-edgedevice.yaml </summary> 

```yaml
apiVersion: shifu.edgenesis.io/v1alpha1
kind: EdgeDevice
metadata:
  name: edgedevice-rpi-gpio
  namespace: devices
spec:
  sku: "RaspberryPi 3B+"
  connection: Ethernet
  address: 0.0.0.0:11112
  protocol: HTTPCommandline
```
</details>

Put these four files into the Raspberry Pi with the following directory contents.

```
led-deploy/
├──deviceshifu-rpi-gpio-configmap.yaml
├──deviceshifu-rpi-gpio-deployment.yaml
├──deviceshifu-rpi-gpio-service.yaml
└──edgedevice-rpi-gpio-edgedevice.yaml
```

Use `kubectl apply -f <dir>` to deploy ***deviceShifu*** to the `k3s` cluster:

<img src="/blog-220507/connect-8.png" width="100%" />

Then check the running status with `kubectl get pods`.

<img src="/blog-220507/connect-9.png" width="100%" />

View all device twins in the cluster with `kubectl get edgedevices -n devices`.

<img src="/blog-220507/connect-10.png" width="100%" />

To see the details of the digital twin via `describe`.

<img src="/blog-220507/connect-11.png" width="100%" />

Next we can interact with the device, where we deploy an `nginx` container to represent the application in a real-world scenario
The deployment command is `kubectl run nginx --image=nginx`

Then execute `kubectl exec -it nginx -- bash` to get to the `nginx` command line

<img src="/blog-220507/connect-12.png" width="100%" />

Finally, using `curl` to send commands to the device, the driver accepts commands in the format: `python led_driver --pin <x> --operate <on/off>`

Using ***Shifu*** to send commands will convert from HTTP to command line, the request address is written as: `http://edgedevice-rpi-gpio/pin?flags_no_parameter=<pin>,--operate,<on/off>`

### Outcome

The program can control the LED bulb on/off by sending an HTTP request directly to the device's domain name.

<img src="/blog-220507/connect-13.gif" width="100%" />

At this point, we have successfully plugged the Raspberry Pi driver into ***Shifu***.
