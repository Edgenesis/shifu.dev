# Deploy Shifu on KubeEdge

The popular open source project `KubeEdge` provides developers with a cloud-edge collaboration solution based on `Kubernetes`. It successfully integrates the cluster orchestration capabilities of `Kubernetes` into the IoT edge scenario, making the scheduling and management of edge computing power lighter and more efficient.

As an open source IoT development framework, ***Shifu*** is also based on `Kubernetes`, its compatibility with multiple devices and virtualization will help `KubeEdge` to be applied at the edge. In fact, the two complement each other very well in terms of capabilities. Not only compatible to multiple devices, `Shifu` running on `KubeEdge` can easily manage lightweight `Pod` running on the edge.

With the powerful combination of `KubeEdge` + ***Shifu***, we can abstract IoT devices into `API` and turn the traditional complex IoT development model into a simple web development model!

Let's see how to make ***Shifu*** run on `KubeEdge` and provide value for developers!

## Introduction

This article will briefly describe the steps to deploy ***Shifu*** on `KubeEdge` and integrate into Hikvision camera (using `RTSP` for video streaming), so that `KubeEdge` architecture can support Hikvision camera.

The architecture used in this article is as follows.

## Preparation

The following services and tools are used in this article.

1. `Kubernetes`: 1.21.5
    - `kubectl`
    - `kubeadm`
    - `kubelet`
1. `Golang`: 1.16.10
1. `Docker`: 19.03.9
1. `KubeEdge`: 1.7.2

Meanwhile, the `Cloud side` and `Edge side` of `KubeEdge` are running on separate `Linux` instances, but both on `Ubuntu Server 20.04` environment.

You need to install all the above mentioned services and tools on the `Cloud side` , but only `Docker` and `KubeEdge` on the `Edge side`.

## Step 1 Deploy Kubernetes on the Cloud side

You can check [official tutorial on Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/) to finish the deployment.

After the deployment is complete we should see the terminal print out the following message.

## Step 2 Deploy Shifu on Cloud side

Clone the `Github` repository of ***Shifu*** to your computer.

```
git clone https://github.com/Edgenesis/shifu.git
```

Then you can deploy ***Shifu*** with the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f shifu/pkg/k8s/crd/install/shifu_install.yml
```

Once deployed we should see that the `CRD controller` for ***Shifu*** has been deployed.

## Step 3 Deploy KubeEdge on Cloud side

For this step, you can refer to [`KubeEdge`'s official tutorial](https://kubeedge.io/zh/docs/setup/keadm/) and use `keadm` for deployment.

After the deployment, we should see the following message printed on the terminal.

<img src="/blog-220608/4.png" width="100%" />

## Step 4 Get the token on the Cloud side

Run the following command.

```
keadm gettoken
```

Please save the `token` you got for the Edge side.

Now that the Cloud side configuration is completed, we switch to the Edge side machine and add it to the cluster.

## Step 5 Join the cluster on the Edge side

Run the following command on the Edge side.

```
keadm join --cloudcore-ipport="<Cloud-side advertise-address>:10000" --token=<token obtained in step 4>
```

After the deployment is complete we should see the terminal print out the following message.

<img src="/blog-220608/5.png" width="100%" />

At this point switch back to the Cloud side and look at the nodes.

<img src="/blog-220608/6.png" width="100%" />

We can see that both the Cloud side and the Edge side have been deployed.

Now we can start deploying the device.

With `KubeEdge`, we can perform `Kubernetes` operations only on the Cloud side and deploy it to the Edge side, while keeping the Edge side free of `Kubernetes` components to keep lightweight.

## Step 6 Modify the Hikvision camera configuration file on the Cloud side

***Shifu*** needs a simple configuration file to generate digital twin. In ***Shifu***, the digital twin is called ***deviceShifu*** and runs in a cluster as `Pod`.

***Shifu*** provides configuration file  to access to Hikvision cameras, here's the path `https://github.com/Edgenesis/shifu/tree/main/examples/rtspDeviceShifu/`.

***Shifu*** deploys ***deviceShifu*** on a machine with a full `Kubernetes` instance by default. In a `KubeEdge` environment, there is no need to run full `Kubernetes` on the edge, so ***Shifu*** also has a lightweight ***deviceShifu*** for cloud-side collaborative environment. We can change `deviceshifu-camera-deployment.yaml` to use the edge-side ***deviceShifu*** and add `nodeName` to deploy it to the `edge node`:

## Step 7 Deploy the Hikvision Camera Pod

On the Cloud side, run the following command.

```
kubectl apply -f shifu/examples/rtspDeviceShifu/camera-deployment
```

At this point, we can look at the `Pod` associated with the camera.

## Final step Confirmation on the Edge side

On the Edge side, we can see that the camera-related Docker container is already running: 

<img src="/blog-220608/9.png" width="100%" />

We can simply call the `capture`/`stream`/`info`/`move` and a host of other `HTTP API`s provided by ***deviceShifu*** to perform operations on the camera, such as the following motion picture.

Related commands.

```
curl edgedevice-camera/move
```

This completes all the steps we need to run ***Shifu*** on `KubeEdge`.
