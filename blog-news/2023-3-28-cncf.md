# Shifu is officially a CNCF landscape project
Edgenesis' Shifu project was recently featured in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation's (CNCF) Cloud Native Landscape, confirming that it meets CNCF standards for technical proficiency and community development. This recognition highlights Shifu's strength and credibility in the field of cloud native computing, solidifying its position as a leader in this area. As a certified CNCF project, Shifu will have even more opportunities to assist AIoT developers in resolving application development challenges.

## The open source community of Shifu develops rapidly
The Shifu IoT development framework was officially open-sourced on August 29th, 2022, and its community is rapidly growing. Currently, there are over 500 members in the developer community in China, and the number of stars on GitHub has exceeded 800. Shifu has successfully integrated with CNCF-certified projects, such as Openyurt, Kubesphere, MicroK8s, and Akri, and can be used as a comprehensive solution with other open-source projects, including Oneflow, EMQ, and Tdengine. Shifu aims to expand its open-source ecosystem further and create high-quality IoT solutions with other projects.

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is a non-profit organization that focuses on developing and maintaining standards, specifications, and tools for cloud-native technologies. The CNCF Landscape Panorama includes mature and widely used products and solutions in the CNCF community that follow the best practices. It's an essential project in CNCF that began in November 2016 and aims to provide a resource map for cloud-native applications, helping developers and enterprises quickly understand the overall cloud-native system and choose suitable software and tools for various component levels.

As a cloud-native framework, Shifu uses the CRD feature of Kubernetes to extend Kubernetes resources and provide features such as high availability, static domain name, and service management. Shifu supports any configuration for any device, and when a physical device connects to Shifu, it recognizes and starts a digital twin device in the form of a K8s Pod. Developers can access all IoT device functions through the deviceShifu interface and define new functions programmatically that the device did not initially have.
## Shifu accelerates the commercial application of IoT
Edgenesis is the founding and core maintenance team behind Shifu. Its employees come mainly from the core cloud computing departments of Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and other major tech companies. In 2022, Edgenesis successfully implemented multi-scenario landing based on the Shifu development framework, supporting the development of unmanned factory data monitoring, industrial 4.0 laboratory software systems, synthetic biodegradable systems, AI quality inspection, AR inspection, and other application scenarios. At Edgenesis, we have established deep cooperation with China Shipbuilding, Xiamen International Trade, Zhijiang Laboratory, Microsoft, Amazon, and other leading enterprises.

In 2022, the Shifu-based solution won the short-listed excellent case of real-time interactive innovation application of ICT Institute. Additionally, it was included in the Amazon Cloud Technology IoT Innovation Case Set and awarded the Zhongguancun Collaborative Innovation Platform Intelligent Networked Automobile Innovation Achievement Award, among other honors. The Shifu development framework's application scalability, stability, and security have been widely recognized in the industry, making it the go-to framework in the innovation scene for many state-owned enterprises.

Shifu's innovative advantage is endowing devices with a "digital brain" that boasts thinking ability through the transparent digital twin technology framework. The digital twin reflects the real-time state of the device, and operations on the digital twin are equivalent to operating the device itself. When IoT devices are connected to Shifu, standardized interfaces are generated to enable internet interaction. Users can collect northbound data and control southbound instructions for all devices and machines in the scene through the platform layer.

Shifu provides bridged device interconnection solutions. The microservice architecture makes the device capability module callable and reusable, with the goal of easily connecting various heterogeneous devices through configuration files. Shifu has achieved access to IoT devices through HTTP, MQTT, TCP Socket, RTSP, OPC UA, and other protocols. It has also integrated with Siemens S7, Hikvision (HIKVISION), and other devices that communicate through private protocols.
## Use Case: Industry 4.0 Laboratory
The Industry 4.0 liquid laboratory is a sophisticated system comprising various equipment, including separators, enzyme analyzers, liquid dispensers, automated guided vehicles, mechanical arms, and more. Edgenesis has developed Shifu, an edge computing platform that abstracts these devices into standardized APIs, enabling digital control and orchestration. By leveraging edge computing, we can achieve real-time data processing and remote device monitoring and analysis through cloud-edge collaboration, leading to improved production efficiency and quality.

Device access and abstraction: Shifu's edge computing technology grants access to the factory's equipment (e.g., separators, enzyme analyzers, liquid dispensers, automated guided vehicles, mechanical arms, etc.) and abstracts them into standardized APIs, facilitating remote control and operation. For instance, mechanical arms, conveyors, and other equipment can be abstracted into APIs for remote control and invocation.

Edge node deployment: To implement edge computing, we need to deploy edge nodes in the factory, which can be industrial computers, embedded devices, and so on. These nodes receive device data, perform data processing and analysis, and send the processed data to the cloud for further processing and analysis. Shifu can help us build edge nodes.

Data processing and analysis: Shifu serves as the core of an IoT platform that can be expanded to connect to AI and data platforms, resulting in an integrated AIoT framework. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms can be used for data processing and analysis on the edge node. For example, image recognition algorithms can provide real-time monitoring and identification of production processes, while data mining algorithms can analyze and predict production data. By employing edge computing, we can achieve real-time data processing and analysis, improving production efficiency and quality.

Control and optimization: Abstracting and controlling the equipment enables us to automate the production process control and optimization through APIs. We can control the motion of the mechanical arm via APIs to pick up the product from the conveyor and send it to the next process, or regulate the start and stop of the equipment via APIs to optimize the entire production process. The integrated AIoT platform enables intelligent control and optimization of the production process.
