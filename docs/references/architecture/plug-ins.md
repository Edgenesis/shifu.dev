# Plug-ins

***Shifu*** has been continuously adding new tools and services to ensure compatibility with different protocols and drivers.

### MQTT Broker

The `MQTT Broker` is used to facilitate the subscription and distribution of MQTT messages. Currently, ***Shifu*** uses [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) to achieve compatibility.

### RTSP Client

The `RTSP Client` guarantees the transmission of streaming information.

### Siemens S7 Suite

`Siemens S7 Suite` supports the operation of Siemens S7 series PLCs. Currently, ***Shifu*** uses [Snap7](http://snap7.sourceforge.net/) to achieve compatibility.

### HTTP to SSH driver stub

The `HTTP to SSH driver stub` enables ***Shifu*** to allow users to add new command line drivers at will. See [remote invocation command line driver](docs\references\advanced-features\customized\README.md).
