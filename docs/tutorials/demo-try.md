# Try out

We have prepared five devices (AGV, thermometer, microplate reader, PLC and robotic arm) in ***Shifu*** installer for you to explore the abilities of ***Shifu***.

:::note
An IoT device is a device that can connect and interact with other devices, systems, and applications offline or online, for instance:

- A robotic arm in a manufacturing plant can receive commands from a local automated control system and complete the corresponding moves.
- An automated guided vehicle can be remotely controlled by its operator.
- A thermometer in a car can send commands to the on-board air conditioner to raise or lower its temperature, and can upload real-time temperature data to the cloud.

When installing ***Shifu*** installer, five virtual devices are created and connected to your computer. Actual IoT devices can be operated through these virtual devices.
:::

## Preparation

Start `nginx` to interact with ***deviceShifu***:

```bash
sudo kubectl run --image=nginx:1.21 nginx
sudo kubectl get pods -A | grep nginx
```

Now, `nginx` is running:

![nginx pod running](images/nginxPodStatus.png)

:::note
In the actual situation, users of IoT devices use an application or a monitoring platform to interact with the digital twin ***deviceShifu***. Here `nginx` is an application or a monitoring platform.
:::

## 1. Interact with the AGV

<details>
  <summary> Click here to view the details of AGV  </summary>
  Q: What is AGV?  <br/>
  A: AGV is a kind of automatic guided transportation vehicle. (Please refer to specific introduction on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_guided_vehicle">Wiki</a>) <br/>
  Q:  How does this interact with the AGV? <br/>
  A:  When the digital twin of the AGV receives the get_position command, it will generate and return the x and y axis coordinates of the current position of the device.
</details>

### Create the digital twin

:::note
You have just installed ***Shifu*** through the ***Shifu*** installer, so the digital twin of the AGV, ***deviceShifu***, has been created automatically.  You can interact with the digital twin of the AGV directly without having to manually create it.

The state of the digital twin will show the state of the actual device, so operating the digital twin is actually operating the actual IoT device.
:::

Execute the following command, and we can see that the digital twin of the AGV has started:

```bash
sudo kubectl get pods -A | grep agv
```

![deviceshifu-agv_start.png](images/deviceshifu-agv_start.png)

![](./images-cluster/cluster-1-en.png)

### Interact with the digital twin

Next, enter the `nginx`:

```bash
sudo kubectl exec -it nginx -- bash
```

By interacting  with the digital twin of the AGV via `http://deviceshifu-agv.deviceshifu.svc.cluster.local`, ***Shifu*** can get the `x` and `y` coordinates of the current position of the AGV:

```bash
curl http://deviceshifu-agv.deviceshifu.svc.cluster.local/get_position; echo
```

</details>

### Create the digital twin

First, start the digital twin of the PLC:

```bash
sudo kubectl apply -f run_dir/shifu/demo_device/edgedevice-plc
```

### Interact with the digital twin

Next, please enter nginx: (if you have not started Nginx, please [start the Nginx service](#start-the-nginx) first)

```bash
sudo kubectl exec -it nginx -- bash
```

By interacting with the PLC digital twin via `http://deviceshifu-plc.deviceshifu.svc.cluster.local`, ***Shifu*** can set bit 0 of the `Q0` memory area of ​​the PLC to 1:

```bash
curl "deviceshifu-plc.deviceshifu.svc.cluster.local/sendsinglebit?rootaddress=Q&address=0&start=0&digit=0&value=1"; echo
```

![deviceshifu-plc_output1.png](images/deviceshifu-plc_output1.png)

"digit" indicates the number of bits in the PLC memory and "value" indicates the value of the current bit. The value of the corresponding memory area bit can be changed by modifying the values of "digit" and "value". For example, the fourth digit value of the Q0 memory of a PLC represents the control program, and the program can be started by setting "digit=3" and "value=1":

```bash
curl "deviceshifu-plc.deviceshifu.svc.cluster.local/sendsinglebit?rootaddress=Q&address=0&start=0&digit=3&value=1"; echo

## 8. Interact with the MQTT Device (Support multi-topic subscription)

<details>
  <summary> Click here to view the details of the MQTT </summary>
  Q: What is a MQTT? <br/>
  A: MQTT is a messaging protocol based on the publish/subscribe paradigm under the ISO standard, please click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT">here</a> for details. <br/>
  Q: How to interact with the MQTT in this demo? <br/>
  A: We support multi-topic subscription, so we can have multiple APIs for MQTT's digital twin (eg: get_topicmsg1, get_topicmsg2), When MQTT's digital twin receives the mqtt_data command, it returns the last message in the subscribed topic.
</details>

### Create the digital twin

First, create a digital twin of the MQTT:

```bash
sudo kubectl apply -f run_dir/shifu/demo_device/edgedevice-mqtt/mosquitto.yaml 
sudo kubectl wait --for=condition=Available deploy/mosquitto -n devices --timeout=150s
sudo kubectl apply -f run_dir/shifu/demo_device/edgedevice-mqtt
```

Enter the following command to see that the digital twin of the MQTT has been started:

```bash
sudo kubectl get pods -A 
```

![deviceshifu-mqtt_pods_start](images/deviceshifu-mqtt_pods_start.png)

### Interact with the digital twin

By communicating with the digital twin of the Socket through `http://deviceshifu-mqtt.deviceshifu.svc.cluster.local`, Shifu can get the command we sent:

```bash
sudo kubectl exec -it nginx -- curl http://deviceshifu-mqtt.deviceshifu.svc.cluster.local/get_topicmsg1
sudo kubectl exec -it nginx -- curl http://deviceshifu-mqtt.deviceshifu.svc.cluster.local/get_topicmsg2
```

![deviceshifu-mqtt_output1.png](images/deviceshifu-mqtt_output1.png)
![deviceshifu-mqtt_output1.png](images/deviceshifu-mqtt_output1.png)

We can use mosquitto to publish data to multiple topics to MQTT server. (The data after -m is the information we posted)

```bash
sudo kubectl exec -it deploy/mosquitto -n devices -- mosquitto_pub -h localhost -d -p 1883 -t /test/test1 -m "test_topicmsg1"
sudo kubectl exec -it deploy/mosquitto -n devices -- mosquitto_pub -h localhost -d -p 1883 -t /test/test2 -m "test_topicmsg2"
```

![deviceshifu-mqtt_output2.png](images/deviceshifu-mqtt_output2.png)
![deviceshifu-mqtt_output3.png](images/deviceshifu-mqtt_output3.png)

At this point we can send commands to the digital twin of MQTT to get the published data.

```bash
sudo kubectl exec -it nginx -- curl http://deviceshifu-mqtt.deviceshifu.svc.cluster.local/get_topicmsg1
sudo kubectl exec -it nginx -- curl http://deviceshifu-mqtt.deviceshifu.svc.cluster.local/get_topicmsg2
```

## Delete the cluster (optional)

During the process of trying ***Shifu***, the ***Shifu*** installer created a cluster on your computer and installed ***Shifu*** in this cluster. If you do not want this cluster to run continuously, you can delete this cluster by executing the following command:

```bash
sudo kind delete cluster
```

`Docker` images can also be deleted. Use command `sudo docker images` to check all images. You can use command `sudo docker rmi <image_id>` to delete useless images.

:::info
Used images:

- `kindest/node` to create a local cluster
- `edgehub/deviceshifu-http-xxxx` to generate a ***deviceShifu*** on the base of it
- `edgehub/mockdevice-xxx` virtual devices
- `edgehub/shifu-controller-telemetry-plugin` a ***Shifu*** plug-in
- `edgehub/shifu-controller` `edgehub/edgedevice-controller-multi` ***Shifu***'s controller
- `nginx` to interact with ***deviceShifu***
:::

Delete the downloaded ***Shifu*** installer `shifu_demo_aio_xxx_xxx.tar` and the folder `testdir`.
