## Restore ***Shifu*** Demo

Please make sure your docker is running first, if you are not sure whether your docker is running or not, please open Terminal and execute the following command in the command line:
```bash
sudo docker ps -a
```
If ``Docker`` is running smoothly, you will get the following output:

You can check the running status of the kind container with the following command.
```bash
sudo docker ps -a 
```
If you do not see any output, you are not running the kind container, go to [download-install](demo-install.md#install-shifu) to install it.

If you see `Status` as `Up`, it means your current kind container is running.

If you see `Status` as `Exited`, your current kind container is not running and you can start it with the following command.

```bash
sudo docker start kind-control-plane
```
Next, use the following command to see ***Shifu*** in action.
```bash
sudo kubectl get pod -n shifu-crd-system
```
If you get the following output, i.e. `Status` is `Running`, then Shifu is running and you can go to [demo-try.md] to continue the experience.

If there is no output or your output is below, i.e. `Status` is `Failed`, then ***Shifu*** is not running or failed to run, you can go to [download-install](demo-install.md#install-shifu) to install it.
