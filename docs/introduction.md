# Platform Introduction

***Shifu*** is derived from the Chinese word "师父". **Teachers, therefore preach, teach and dispel doubts.**. As a next-generation open source IoT development framework, ***Shifu*** has gain control over IoT devices and successfully endow such capabilities to developers in the form of APIs. In this way, traditional IoT application development is reduced to simple web development, which greatly improves the efficiency, quality and reusability of IoT application development.

## Innovation Advantages

### 🌨️ Cloud-native
As a cloud-native framework, ***Shifu*** extends the resources of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) through its [CRD feature](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/) to achieve high availability, static domain names, service management, etc. ***Shifu*** can support any form of configuration for any device. When a physical device is connected, ***Shifu*** recognizes and starts the device's digital twin deviceShifu as a [Kubernetes Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/). Developers can access all the features of an IoT device by accessing the deviceShifu API, you can also define features that the device doesn't originally have. The cloud-native ***Shifu*** makes system O&M much easier, and application developers can manage O&M through a set of Kubernetes infrastructure. ***Shifu*** will extend Kubernetes' capabilities in order to become the underlying architecture standard for IoT development, bringing container orchestration technology to the IoT software development ecosystem.
### 👥 Digital Twins
Leveraging on digital twin technology, ***Shifu*** successfully empowers devices with a thinking "digital brain". The digital twin will reflect the real-time state of the device, and developing operations on it is equivalent to operating the device itself. IoT devices plugged into ***Shifu*** will generate standardized APIs for interaction, achieve northbound data collection and southbound command control for all devices within the scene through the platform layer.
