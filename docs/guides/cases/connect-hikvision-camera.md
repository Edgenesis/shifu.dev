# Connect a Hikvision Camera

## Get the template

Check template files at [examples/rtspDeviceShifu](https://github.com/Edgenesis/shifu/tree/main/examples/rtspDeviceShifu).

## Modify configuration

In `examples/rtspDeviceShifu/camera-deployment/deviceshifu-camera-deployment.yaml`:

```yaml
spec:
  ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      containers:
      ...
      - image: edgehub/camera-python:v0.0.1
        ...
        env:
        - name: EDGEDEVICE_NAME
          value: "edgedevice-camera"
        - name: EDGEDEVICE_NAMESPACE
          value: "devices"
        - name: IP_CAMERA_ADDRESS
          value: "192.168.14.254" # change this value
        - name: IP_CAMERA_USERNAME
          value: "admin" # change this value
        - name: IP_CAMERA_PASSWORD
          value: "password" # change this value
        - name: IP_CAMERA_CONTAINER_PORT
          value: "11112" # change this value
        ...
```

::: Recommend using `Secret` to store passwords, which is not necessary for access devices, but this will greatly enhance security

1. Create a `Secret` with `rtsp_password` field filled by your password.

```bash
kubectl create secret generic deviceshifu-secret --from-literal=rtsp_password=your_password -n deviceshifu
```

2. Modify the yaml file above, change the value of enviroment varible `IP_CAMERA_PASSWORD` from string to `Secret` we just created.

```yaml
- name: IP_CAMERA_PASSWORD
  valueFrom:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: deviceshifu-secret
      key: rtsp_password
      optional: false
```

:::tip
To check the ip address of your camera, use the official tool provided by Hikvision:

**SADP**

- [macOS download](https://www.hikvision.com/en/support/tools/hitools/cl3620e9fb51dfac31/)
- [Windows download](https://www.hikvision.com/en/support/tools/hitools/clea8b3e4ea7da90a9/)

## Deploy deviceShifu

Run the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f examples/rtspDeviceShifu/camera-deployment
```

## Interact with deviceShifu

In `examples/rtspDeviceShifu/camera-deployment/deviceshifu-camera-configmap.yaml`:

```yaml
data:
  ...
  instructions: |
    ...
    instructions:
      capture:
      info:
      stream:
      move/up:
      move/down:
      move/left:
      move/right:
```

You can use these instructions to interact with the ***deviceShifu***, which is equal to operate on the actual Hikvision camera.

## Accessing the camera via browser

We can access the pod through service, we have set the corresponding service in the default yaml file, now we just need to use it to enable port forwarding

Get the current list of services with the following command 

```
kubectl get svc -A 
```
The service that has been around for the shortest time is the one we just added, and we can enable port forwarding with the following command

```
kubectl port-forward -n deviceshifu svc/<fill in the name of the service we just added> 3000:
```
If it runs smoothly we can see the following output

```
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:3000 -> 8080
Forwarding from [::1]:3000 -> 8080
```


Then you can access the camera from the browser
For example, accessing `localhost:3000/info` should display information about the camera
Replace info with another instruction to achieve the corresponding function
