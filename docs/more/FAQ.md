> What is the relationship between ***Shifu*** and `Kubernetes`?

As a cloud-native framework, ***Shifu*** extends `Kubernetes` resources through `Kubernetes` `CRD features` to achieve high availability, static domain names, service management, etc. ***Shifu*** can support any kind of configuration for any device. When a physical device is connected, ***Shifu*** recognizes and launches the digital twin of that device as a `Kubernetes Pod` ***deviceShifu***. By accessing the interface to ***deviceShifu***, developers can access all the features of an IoT device, while programmatically defining features that the device would not otherwise have.
